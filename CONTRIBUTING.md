# Contributions are welcome

We need volunteer developers, such as you, to help make the Quantum Refinement project a massive success.

Here are some important resources:

  * [Website](https://qrefine.com/) tells you all about us and our open source project,
  * [Source code](https://github.com/qrefine/qrefine) is our repo for the entire project.
  * [Our tasks](https://github.com/qrefine/qrefine/projects) is our way of tracking important tasks.
  * Mailing list: Join our [developer list](http://groups.google.com/group/qrefine/)
  * Bugs? [Issue tracker](https://github.com/qrefine/qrefine/issues) is where to report them
  * Slack:[channel](https://qrefineworkspace.slack.com). We're usually there during business hours.

## Testing

We have a few dozen unit tests, but most of them are rather slow. Please always add a test when you submit a pull request. Please try and make your tests run as quickly as possible.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to qrefine](https://github.com/qrefine/qrefine/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

 We are trying to have readable code:

  * We indent using two spaces.
  * This is open source scientific software. Consider all of the people who will try and read your code. 
  * Please use the log object to keep track of what is happening in your code. 
  

Thanks in advance,
The Q|R team of core developers
